### Purpose
This was to familiarize myself with writing functions to speed up things I have to do often!

### Summary
Given two data sets (dfA and dfB), I wrote a function to do the following:
* Merge them
* Print the number of rows from the returned dataset in dfA AND dfB
* Print the number of rows from the returned dataset in dfA BUT NOT dfB
* Print the number of rows from the returned dataset in dfB BUT NOT dfA
* Print some diagnostic statistics
